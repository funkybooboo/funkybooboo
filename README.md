## About

I'm a software engineer interning at Domo in American Fork, where my internship has been extended based on strong performance and contributions to production systems at scale. I also serve as a Teaching Assistant for Introduction to Software Engineering at Utah State University, where I've been nominated for TA of the Year in 2025. Beyond traditional TA responsibilities, I deliver lectures to students, mentor them on proper software development practices, design patterns, and industry best practices, and guide them through real-world software engineering challenges that prepare them for their careers.

## Education & Academic Excellence

I'm currently halfway through my Master's program in Computer Science at Utah State University, specializing in Artificial Intelligence. Throughout my AI coursework, I've consistently demonstrated not just completion but genuine mastery of core concepts. I hold a Bachelor's in Computer Science from USU, and during my undergraduate studies, I was nominated for Undergraduate Researcher of the Year in 2024. This academic foundation complements my practical experience, allowing me to bridge theoretical computer science with real-world engineering problems.

## Development Philosophy

I'm a strong advocate for the [Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/) methodology and apply these principles rigorously across all my projects. This disciplined approach ensures that the applications I build are designed for scalability, maintainability, and cloud-native deployment from the ground up. The twelve-factor methodology guides my decisions around codebase management, dependency handling, configuration, backing services, and deployment processes, resulting in software that's truly production-ready and resilient at scale.

## Featured Projects

One of my notable projects is [Rylee](https://github.com/funkybooboo/rylee), an advanced chess engine that mimics human playing behavior using AI techniques. This project demonstrates practical application of machine learning concepts to create naturalistic gameplay patterns, going beyond simple optimization to capture the nuances of human decision-making in chess.

I'm also developing [Alle](https://github.com/funkybooboo/alle), a custom-built task management application. Rather than settling for existing solutions, I built this from the ground up to extend TeuxDeux functionality with features tailored specifically to my workflow, addressing productivity needs that off-the-shelf applications couldn't satisfy.

My [homelab infrastructure](https://github.com/funkybooboo/homelab) represents my commitment to infrastructure-as-code and systems engineering. This project includes automated deployment and configuration management, a Tor relay node contributing to the privacy network, network-attached storage setup, and Raspberry Pi-based automation systems. I use n8n extensively to automate tedious tasks and eliminate repetitive workflows, allowing me to focus on more interesting problems. The entire environment is managed as code, making it reproducible, maintainable, and a practical learning ground for infrastructure concepts.

## Technical Focus & Daily Practice

I'm a Linux power user who feels most at home in the terminal. I take cybersecurity very seriously, running GrapheneOS on my mobile device for security hardening as part of my commitment to privacy and security.

My learning never stops. I solve a LeetCode problem every day to maintain and sharpen my algorithmic thinking skills. I regularly tackle CodeCrafters challenges to deepen my understanding of systems programming. This daily practice, combined with my work on multiple personal projects, ensures I'm constantly growing as an engineer and staying current with evolving technologies and methodologies.

My core competencies span software architecture and design patterns, artificial intelligence and machine learning, systems programming and automation, DevOps and infrastructure-as-code practices, and teaching and mentoring. I believe in building software the right way, which means thinking about scalability, security, and maintainability from day one.

## Let's Connect

I'm always interested in discussing software engineering, systems architecture, AI applications, homelab setups, or any interesting technical challenges.
