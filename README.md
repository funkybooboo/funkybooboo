## About

Software engineer with production experience at Domo building scalable data pipelines and cloud integrations, processing 10M+ records daily. MS Computer Science candidate at Utah State University specializing in AI/ML with published research in IEEE and ACM. Nominated for TA of the Year 2025 for exceptional teaching in software engineering and multi-agent systems.

Previously Junior Software Engineer at Provider Resources Inc, where I championed TDD adoption (increasing code coverage from 40% to 85%), led Docker containerization initiatives (reducing deployment time from 2 hours to 15 minutes), and architected workflow automation solutions saving $50K annually.

## Development Philosophy

Strong advocate for clean architecture, test-driven development, and [twelve-factor methodology](https://12factor.net/). I apply these principles rigorously to ensure scalability, maintainability, and cloud-native deployment. Linux power user (Arch/NixOS) with deep systems programming knowledge. Daily LeetCode practitioner and CodeCrafters contributor maintaining sharp algorithmic skills.

## Featured Projects

### [Alle](https://github.com/funkybooboo/alle) - Custom Task Management SaaS
Architected full-stack application using React 19/TypeScript frontend and Rust/Tokio backend with GraphQL API, serving 100+ daily active users. Achieved 85% code coverage through comprehensive testing strategy with 60+ unit, integration, and E2E tests. Deployed with Docker Compose, SeaORM/SQLite, and Tower HTTP framework with 99.9% uptime.

### [StdLib](https://github.com/funkybooboo/stdlib) - Standard Library from First Principles
Implemented standard library with core data structures, algorithms, and math utilities entirely from scratch in Rust without any third-party dependencies. Built comprehensive collection including vectors, linked lists, hash maps, trees, sorting algorithms, and memory management utilities.

### [NateOS](https://github.com/funkybooboo/nateos) - Custom Operating System
Developed monolithic operating system from scratch using x86 Assembly and C, including custom bootloader, kernel, and memory management. Implemented process scheduling, interrupt handling, GDT/IDT setup, and hardware interaction.

### [LazyCSV](https://github.com/funkybooboo/lazycsv) - Terminal UI for CSV Files
Blazingly fast terminal UI for CSV files with vim-style navigation. Handles huge datasets with minimal memory footprint, enabling mouse-free data exploration in terminal environments.

### [InsightHub](https://github.com/funkybooboo/insighthub) - RAG System Platform
Flexible platform for building, configuring, and comparing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems across any dataset. Modular pipeline architecture supporting multiple embedding models, LLMs, and vector databases.

### [Homelab](https://github.com/funkybooboo/homelab) - Infrastructure Automation Platform
Built infrastructure-as-code homelab with automated deployment, containerized services using Docker/Kubernetes, and n8n workflow automation. Configured network security with VLANs, firewall rules, and Tailscale VPN.

### [Rylee](https://github.com/funkybooboo/rylee) - Chess Engine
Advanced chess engine mimicking human playing behavior using AI techniques and machine learning, capturing nuances of human decision-making beyond simple optimization.
